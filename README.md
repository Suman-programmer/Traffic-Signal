# Traffic-Signal
Main aim of this Mini Project is to illustrate the concepts and usage of pre-built function in OpenGL. 
Simulation of a traffic signal is being done using computer graphics.  
The car built using cubes can be moved using arrow keys and based on traffic signal light the user can obey the traffic rules.  
If the car hits other car then accident scene is shown. 
WE have used input devices like mouse and keyboard to interact with program
